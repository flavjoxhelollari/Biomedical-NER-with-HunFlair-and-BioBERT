It recognize and extract from the text and classify thema based one the predefined semantic types such as person, location, organization etc [1]. It also helps to locate the profer nouns in a text. The selected named entities carry key information which can be applied for language processing applications [2]. Highly accurate NER also can be used for the nature language processing (NLP) as a key source information. It helps a lots of fields such as information searching and summurization, answering the questions based on the database[3]. Especially, it improves the quality of the machine translation (MT) and it guides to the user to get profer translations results.\n",

GNT is the entities with common classficication such as names(person), location etc. DNE is the named entities with special terms from specific topics such as neuroscience words from biomedical fields, wireless power transmission from electrical engineering fields and so on.

Especially, biomedical entitiy(i.e. genes, chemicals or diseases) recognitionss in unstructured scientific text is mandatry step for extracting the biomedical informations. Needs on the biomedical NER has been rised due to the rapid development of biomedical research which the number of the documents increases with exponential growth[5]. These trends affected to the scientiest who are engaged in biomedical fields to follow the pace with the state-of-the-art researches. Addtionally, the needs of the effective with high accuracy natural language processing (NLP) tools to help manage, organize and retrieve the biomedical information.  \n",

        "These needs accelerated to develop the Biomedical NER from the lot of research groups. SciSpacy, which is one of the fast and robust model for NLP has been released in 2019[5]. The HUNER tagger[8] also released in the same year which was trained on a large collection of biomedical NER dataset. This model leads to a higher performace on unseen corpora compared to the model trained on a single corpus. However, this model is not able to connect to any of the major NLP frameworks for further processings because it relies on a Docker installation which are the client-server architecture. Therefore, they suggested the new model, HunFlair, which relies on the Flair NLP architechture, which is on of the easy to use NLP framework(Akbik et al., 2019) [9] which is fast with high accuracy on biomedical NER.\n",

(2019) by merging character-level pretraining and joint training on multiple gold standard corpora, which leads to strong gains over other state-of-the-art standalone NER tools. Integration into Flair adds very simple usage even for non-experts: HunFlair can be installed with a single command and applied with only a few lines of code. Additionally, we integrate 23 biomedical NER corpora into HunFlair using a consistent format, which enables researchers and practitioners to rapidly train their own models and experiment with new approaches.**\n",

        "# Claim Validation - NER on NCBI corpus: HunFlair vs BioBERT\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper claims that HunFlair is an easy to use tool, that performs very well when it comes to different tasks. It is pre-trained on a huge amount of data, and it is very robust. This makes HunFlair able to outperform the state-of-the-art models on any NLP task. We came accross some results on the NCBI Disease, and in this case HunFlair failed to outperform one of its competitors: BioBERT. This drew my attention, and that is why we decided to work on proving that biomedical NER on NCBI-disease corpus with BioBERT is better than NER with HunFlair. \\\n",
        "After running some experiments on both HunFlair and BioBERT, we ended up in the conclusion that BioBERT acheives a higher F1-score in most of the run cases. \\\\\n",

        "The graph above is a result of HunFlair. After running for more than 20 epochs, the HunFlair model manages to acheive an F1-score of roughly 94.83 on the evaluation set of NCBI. This is a very good performance, considering we are using the pre-trained weights, and the time it takes to fine-tune the model is relatively short (almost half an hour) and the whole process is fairly straightforward. But, on the other hand, using BioBERT on the same corpus, for a much shorter time $(<18 min)$ , we mananged to acheive an F1-score (on evaluation set) of 97.46, with only two epochs. This implies that NER with BioBERT on NCBI is much faster and the results are much better than the rest of the competitors, including here HunFlair. \\\\\n",
